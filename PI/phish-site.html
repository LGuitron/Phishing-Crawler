 fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal
 law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record

 When you open an account, the Lender will obtain your name, address, 
date of birth, and other information that will allow the Lender to 
identify you. The Lender may verify this information with you and 
others. The Lender may also request to see your driver's license or

important protections to members of the Armed Forces and their

rate must include, as applicable to the credit transaction or account: 
The costs associated with credit insurance premiums; fees for ancillary 
products sold in connection with the credit transaction; any application
 fee charged (other than certain application fees for specified credit 
transactions or accounts); and any participation fee charged (other than
 certain participation fees for a credit card account). None of these 
types of costs or fees apply to your PayPal Credit Account. Your APR is 
reflected in the disclosures above. If you would like to listen to this

credit, we will disclose to you the total amount of your Credit Line,

PayPal Credit account and are making a purchase, you agree that if we 
identify your existing account, your purchase will be charged to your 
existing account and a new account will not be opened.<br><br>The total 
balances of all types of transactions on the Account plus transactions 
which have been authorized but not yet posted to the Account (but not 
including unpaid fees) may not exceed the Credit Line.<br><br>If you try
 to make a Purchase or Cash Advance that would cause your outstanding 
balance to be above your Credit Line, we may treat that as a request to 
increase the Credit Line.<p><em>For example: If your Credit Line is 
$650.00, you have a $200.00 balance, and you try to make a Purchase or 
request a Cash Advance of $500.00, we may treat this as a request for an
 increase in the Credit Line. If we approve this transaction, your new 
Credit Line will be $700.00.</em></p>We have the option to refuse a 
request for an increase, but we will notify you of the reasons for any 
refusal. We may allow you to complete a transaction in excess of your 
available credit without increasing your Credit Line under certain 
circumstances, such as if you have a previous "non-sufficient funds" 
payment on your Account.<br><br>We may increase, decrease or change your Credit Line at any time. We will notify you if we do so.<br><br>From
 time to time, we may review your Account to ensure that payments and 
transactions posting to your Account are valid and not fraudulent and 
that good funds are collected for payments. In doing so, we may 
temporarily limit your ability to utilize the total credit available to 
borrow until the Account review is completed and/or transactions and

      <p><span class="zero-margin">We use a daily rate to calculate the 
interest on the balance on your account each day. The daily rate is the 
applicable APR times 1/365. Interest will be imposed in amounts or at 
rates not in excess of those permitted by applicable law. The APR for 
Purchases and Cash Advances is the prime rate plus 20.74%. As of October 
1, 2018, the daily rate for Purchases and Cash Advances is 0.0712054% (APR
 25.99%). However, if we have disclosed a special promotional rate at 
the time we made the special offer, we will calculate interest on 
balances subject to that special offer using the applicable special 
promotional rate.<br><br><strong>Daily Rates May Vary.</strong> The APR 
and the daily rates on your account vary with the market based on the 
prime rate. The prime rate for a billing cycle is the highest bank prime
 loan rate published in <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>  in its Money Rates section on the last business day of the calendar month preceding the first day of the billing cycle.<br><br>If
 the prime rate increases, the daily rates and APRs will increase. As a 
result, interest, your total minimum payment and the number of payments 
it would take you to pay off your account balance may increase. We apply
 any change in rates because of a prime rate change to your entire 
account balance. A change in the prime rate will take effect on the 
first day of the first billing cycle after the change. We may select a 
new interest rate index if the prime rate is not available.</span></p>

        <div class="titletb col-xs-12 col-sm-3">Arbitration Procedures</div>
        <div class="contenttb2 col-xs-12 col-sm-9">Arbitration is more 
informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator 
or arbitrators instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an 
arbitration award is very limited. However, the arbitrator(s) can award 
the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can 
award to an individual. The arbitrator(s) also must follow the terms of 
these Terms and Conditions as a court would. All issues are for the 
arbitrator(s) to decide, except that issues relating to arbitrability, 
the scope or enforceability of this Agreement to Arbitrate, or the 
interpretation of the subsection above entitled "Prohibition of Class 
and Representative Actions and Non-individualized Relief," shall be for a
 court of competent jurisdiction to decide. The arbitration will be 
conducted by the AAA under its rules and procedures, including the AAA's
 Consumer Arbitration Rules (as applicable), as modified by this 
Agreement to Arbitrate. The AAA's rules are available at <a href="https://www.adr.org/" target="_blank" pa-marked="1">www.adr.org</a>.<br><br>The
 arbitration shall be held in the county in which you reside or at 
another mutually agreed location. If the value of the relief sought is 
$10,000 or less, you or we may elect to have the arbitration conducted 
by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election 
shall be binding on you and us subject to the discretion of the 
arbitrator(s) to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances 
warrant. Attendance at an in-person hearing may be made by telephone by 
you and/or us, unless the arbitrator(s) requires otherwise.<br><br>The 
arbitrator(s) will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with
 applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will 
honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator(s) shall
 not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different 
PayPal Credit users, but is/are bound by rulings in prior arbitrations 
involving the same PayPal Credit user to the extent required by 
applicable law. The award of the arbitrator(s) shall be final and 
binding, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be 
entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Any settlement offer 
made by you or us shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator.</div>

        <div class="titletb col-xs-12 col-sm-3">Costs of Arbitration</div>
        <div class="contenttb2 col-xs-12 col-sm-9">Payment of all 
filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the 
AAA's rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate. If 
the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, we 
will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees associated with
 the arbitration. Any request for payment of fees by us should be 
submitted to the AAA in your Demand for Arbitration and we will make 
arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to the AAA. If the value
 of the relief sought is more than $10,000 and you are able to 
demonstrate that the costs of accessing arbitration will be prohibitive 
as compared to the costs of accessing a court for purposes of pursuing 
litigation on an individual basis, we will pay as much of the filing, 
administration, and arbitrator fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to
 prevent the cost of accessing arbitration from being prohibitive. In 
the event the arbitrator determines the Claim(s) you assert in the 
arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse us for all fees 
associated with the arbitration paid by us on your behalf that you 
otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA's rules.</div>

        <div class="contenttb2 col-xs-12 col-sm-9">With the exception of
 any of the provisions in the Prohibition of Class and Representative 
Actions and Non-Individualized Relief subsection above, if a court 
decides that any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate is invalid or 
unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall 
still apply. If a court decides that any of the provisions in the 
Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized 
Relief subsection above is invalid or unenforceable because it would 
prevent the exercise of a nonwaivable right to pursue public injunctive 
relief, then any dispute regarding the entitlement to such relief (and 
only that relief) must be severed from arbitration and may be litigated 
in court. If a court decides that any provision in the Prohibition of 
class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief 
subsection above is invalid or unenforceable with respect to a Claim, 
then this Agreement to Arbitrate shall not apply to that Claim.<br><br>Notwithstanding
 any provision in the Terms and Conditions to the contrary, you and we 
agree that if we make any amendment to this Agreement to Arbitrate 
(other than an amendment to any notice address or website link provided 
in the Agreement to Arbitrate) in the future, that amendment shall not 
apply to any Claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against us prior
 to the effective date of the amendment. The amendment shall apply to 
all other disputes or Claims governed by the Agreement to Arbitrate. We 
will notify you of amendments to this Agreement to Arbitrate by posting 
the amended terms on <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/home" target="_blank" pa-marked="1">www.paypal.com</a>
 at least 30 days before the effective date of the amendments and by 
providing mail notice. If you do not agree to these amended terms, you 
may close your Account within the 30 day period and you will not be

Box 5018, Timonium, MD 21094</strong>
 or call customer service at 1-866-528-3733. If your PayPal Credit 
Account is linked to a PayPal Account, you can also communicate the 
error through the Resolution Center on <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/home" target="_blank" pa-marked="1">www.paypal.com</a>. If you write to us, in your letter, give us the following information:</p>
    <ul class="list-indent">
      <li class="zero-margin"><em>Account information:</em> Your name and account number.</li>
      <li class="zero-margin"><em>Dollar amount:</em> The dollar amount of the suspected error.</li>
      <li class="zero-margin"><em>Description of problem:</em> If you think there is an error on your bill, describe what you believe is wrong and why you believe it is a mistake.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="zero-margin">You must contact us:</p>
    <ul class="list-indent">
      <li class="zero-margin">Within 60 days after the error appeared on your statement.</li>
      <li class="zero-margin">At least 3 business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if you want to stop payment on the amount you think is wrong.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="zero-margin">You must notify us of any potential errors <em>in writing by mail, through the Resolution Center on <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/home" target="_blank" pa-marked="1">www.paypal.com</a> (if you have a PayPal account), or by calling customer service at 1-866-528-3733.</em>
 You may email us, but if you do we are not required to investigate any 
potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question.<br><br><strong>What Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter</strong><br>When we receive your letter, we must do two things:</p>
    <ol class="zero-margin list-indent">
      <li class="zero-margin">Within 30 days of receiving your letter, 
we must tell you that we received your letter. We will also tell you if 
we have already corrected the error.</li>
      <li class="zero-margin">Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the bill is correct.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="zero-margin">While we investigate whether or not there has been an error:</p>
    <ul class="list-indent">
      <li class="zero-margin">We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount.</li>
      <li class="zero-margin">The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount.</li>
      <li class="zero-margin">While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance.</li>
      <li class="zero-margin">We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit line.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="zero-margin">After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen:</p>
    <ul class="list-indent">
      <li class="zero-margin"><em>If we made a mistake:</em> You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount.</li>
      <li class="zero-margin"><em>If we do not believe there was a mistake:</em>
 You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable 
interest and fees. We will send you a statement of the amount you owe 
and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you
 do not pay the amount we think you owe.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="zero-margin">If you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us within <em>10 days</em>
 telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report
 you as delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your 
bill. We must tell you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as 
delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when the matter has
 been settled between us.<br><br>If we do not follow all of the rules 
above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount you question 
even if your bill is correct.<br><br><strong>Your Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases</strong><br>If
 you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased
 with your credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the 
problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the 
remaining amount due on the purchase.<br>To use this right, all of the following must be true:</p>
    <ol class="zero-margin list-indent">
      <li class="zero-margin">The purchase must have been made in your 
home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the 
purchase price must have been more than $50. (<em>Note:</em> Neither of 
these are necessary if your Purchase was based on an advertisement we 
mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or 
services).</li>
      <li class="zero-margin">You must have used your credit card for 
the purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with a 
check that accesses your credit card account do not qualify.</li>
      <li class="zero-margin">You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us <em>in writing</em> at: <strong>PayPal Credit, P.O. Box 5018, Timonium, MD 21094</strong>
 or call customer service at 1-866-528-3733. If your PayPal Credit 
Account is linked to a PayPal account, you can also communicate through 
the Resolution Center on <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/home" target="_blank" pa-marked="1">www.paypal.com</a>.<br><br>While
 we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as 
discussed above. After we finish our investigation, we will tell you our
 decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and you do not 
pay, we may report you as delinquent.</p>

<h3>What is PayPal Credit?</h3>
<p>PayPal Credit is a credit line that is built in to your PayPal account. You can use PayPal Credit during PayPal checkout on eBay and almost everywhere PayPal is accepted. In fact, set it as your preferred payment method and youâ€™ll speed through PayPal checkout even faster. <br /><a href="#">Back to top</a></p>


<h3>How does PayPal Credit work with PayPal?</h3>
<p>The next time you check out with PayPal, simply select PayPal Credit as your payment method. Answer 2 quick questions: your birth date and your Social Security number. Approval takes only seconds. Once approved, PayPal Credit will automatically be added to your PayPal account <em>.</em><br /><a href="#">Back to top</a></p>


<h3>Why should I use PayPal Credit for my PayPal purchases?</h3>
<p>Get more time to pay when you check out with PayPal and pay with PayPal Credit at most places PayPal is accepted. Plus, score valuable discounts and offers, like special financing on purchases of $99 or more, when you use PayPal Credit. You can also review all of your purchases and pay your bill through PayPal.com.<br /><a href="#">Back to top</a></p>


<h3>I already have a separate PayPal Credit account. How do I add it to my PayPal account?</h3>
<p>Itâ€™s easy! Visit <a href="https://www.paypal.com/myaccount/credit/accountLinking"> www.paypal.com/myaccount/credit/accountLinking </a> and follow the simple steps to easily link your PayPal Credit account to your PayPal account.  <br /><a href="#">Back to top</a></p>


<h3>How do I pay my PayPal Credit bill? </h3>
<p>Simply log in to PayPal.com.  On your Account Overview summary, you will see your current payment due for PayPal Credit. You can use your PayPal balance or your bank account, plus, you can pay in full or over time (interest charges may apply).<br /><a href="#">Back to top</a></p>

<h3>How does the "No Payments + No Interest if paid in full in 6 months" offer work?</h3>
<p>You can choose to make no payments for 6 months. You will receive monthly statements and can make payments at any time. As long as you pay in full by the promotion expiration date, you will not be billed interest. If you do not pay in full, interest will be billed from the date of purchase.<br /><a href="#">Back to top</a></p>


<h3>Is there an annual fee to use PayPal Credit?</h3>
<p>There is no annual fee for using PayPal Credit.<br /><a href="#">Back to top</a></p>


<h3>What is the Annual Percentage Rate?</h3>
<p>The Annual Percentage Rate is 19.99%. The Minimum Finance Charge is $2.00. Of course, you can choose to pay your entire balance by the payment due date and pay no finance charges.<br /><a href="#">Back to top</a></p>



<h3>If I pay late, will there be a fee?</h3>
<p>If a minimum payment is not received by your payment due date (found on your statement), you will be charged a late fee in the amount of the missed paymentâ€”up to $27 the first time you are late. Subsequent late payments will be charged a late fee up to $38.<br /><a href="#">Back to top</a></p>


<h3>Does PayPal Purchase Protection apply to my PayPal Credit purchases?</h3>
<p>When you check out with PayPal and choose PayPal Credit as your payment method, the purchases are covered under PayPal's Purchase Protection program. <a href="https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/paypal-safety-and-security" target="_blank">See Eligibility</a>.<br /><a href="#">Back to top</a></p>



<h3>Do I have a credit line and how much is it?</h3>
<p>Yes you do. Here's how it works: after you've been approved,  Comenity Capital Bank will open a PayPal Credit account with a credit line equal to the amount of your purchase or $250, whichever is greater.</p>

<p>You can continue using PayPal Credit to make purchases. If those purchases cause your outstanding balance to exceed your credit line, then you will be evaluated for a credit line increase. This evaluation happens seamlessly during the checkout process. You don't need to do a thing. Best of all, your checkout won't be slowed down.
Here's an example of how this works:

<ul>
<li>If your first purchase using PayPal Credit is $150, your initial credit line will be $250.</li>
<li>If you make another purchase for $300 before your bill is paid, PayPal Credit will determine during checkout if your credit line can be adjusted to $450.</li>
<li>If you then pay $350 toward your first bill, you will have $350 remaining on your credit line. If you want to make another purchase using PayPal Credit for more than $350, PayPal Credit will determine during checkout if your credit line can be adjusted again.</li>
<li>You can always continue to make additional purchases up to your outstanding credit line, and we will consider increasing your credit line when your purchase goes above it.</li>
</ul>
<a href="#">Back to top</a></p>


<h3>What does "Subject to Credit Approval" mean?</h3>
<p>PayPal Credit is a line of credit provided by  Comenity Capital Bank, an FDIC-insured, Utah-chartered, industrial bank.  Comenity Capital Bank will review and consider your credit report and other credit-related information prior to opening your account and establishing your credit line. Creditworthiness is determined by  Comenity Capital Bank and only takes a matter of seconds as part of the checkout process.<br /><a href="#">Back to top</a></p>


<h3>How do I increase my credit line with PayPal Credit?</h3>
<p>When you attempt to make a purchase for an amount above your credit line, it will be treated as a request for a credit line increase. Your eligibility for a credit line increase is determined by your credit history and customer history with PayPal Credit. This request happens seamlessly during the checkout process. You literally don't do anything on your end, and best of all, it won't slow down your checkout.<br /><a href="#">Back to top</a></p>


<h3>Where else can I use PayPal Credit?</h3>
<p>PayPal Credit is available at most places PayPal is accepted. It is also available exclusively on thousands of other online stores that accept PayPal Credit.<br /><a href="#">Back to top</a></p>
